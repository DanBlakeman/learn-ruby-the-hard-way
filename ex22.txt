FILE               file class
open(a, 'w')             open the 'a' file in writable way
r,w,a                 used in the above: read, (over)write, append
+                     as above makes read writer

.first              return first value in an array
readline            returns a particular line in file
truncate(0)            empties the file to zero bytes
.write('s')               writes 's' to a file
.exist?               checks whether a file exists
*args                 accepts unspecified args, adds to array
end                   ends a code block/method/loop etc
<<END                 heredocs - essentially creates a mini file
